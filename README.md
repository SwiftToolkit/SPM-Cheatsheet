## Adding Package Dependencies

## Targets Vs Products

While they might sound confusing, target and products are not exactly the same. A `Target` is the most basic building block of a package: it contains source files and possibly resources as well. Targets can depend on other targets. A `Product`, in the other hand, is how you can wrap a target and offer it to external consumers of your package. It can be either a library, an executable, or a plugin - you can find more on that below.

### Targets

### Products

## Platforms
